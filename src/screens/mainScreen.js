            Hello, welcome to my website! My name is Semi YÃ¶net, I'm a currently working as a lead developer/ Backend
            developer in CloudVentures, in the Desty Project. Some examples of the product we've built
            are <a href={'https://good.travel'} className={'text-red-600'}>good.travel </a>
            I've been coding since I was 14 and coding is something I've started to have fun. That's why even though
            it's
            my job, I do coding on my spare time as well. That's why I love new technologies and it's the main reason I
            created this website!
            <br/><br/>
            If you would like to talk with me feel free to press the Contact button at left bottom of this screen. Press
