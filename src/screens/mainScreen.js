            Hello, welcome to my website! My name is Semih YÃ¶net, I'm a Software Engineer, also a PM in PlusClouds!
            I've been coding since I was 14 and coding is something I've started to have fun. That's why even though
            it's
            my job, I do coding on my spare time as well. That's why I love new technologies and it's the main reason I
            created this website!
            <br/><br/>
